## Idea
Educhain Based Research Repository

## Description	
A repository for academic research papers, ensuring immutability and accessibility.

## Execution
Using [PINATA](https://www.pinata.cloud/), I am storing the research paper on IPFS for this project. After that, it was kept in the EDU chain for everyone to access and maintain immutability.
